Instructions

You can find two files in this repository:

MySQL/create.sql
This file helps you create a database and a table to receive the measurements form the episensor

PHP/parser.php
This is the most important file, it is parsing all the files you send via FTP to a folder from the Episensor device, write the in the database and then (optional) delete the file forever.


Example:

Let's say you set-up your Episensor Gateway to send via FTP to domainwhereepisensorsends.com/datafolder/ then you change the URL in the parser file and run the parser.php. 

The parser will read the folder and add the values in the database (mac,datetime,value).
